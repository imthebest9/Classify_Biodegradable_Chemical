# Description

The QSAR dataset is a dataset built in Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group (UniversitÃ degli Studi Milano â€“ Bicocca, Milano, Italy). The dataset contain values for 41 attributes (molecular descriptors) used to classify 1055 chemicals into 2 classes (ready and not ready biodegradable). This data set is used to study the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules.

In this project, 2 models had been developed to predict whether the chemicals are ready biodegradable (RB) or not ready biodegradable (NRB). The 2 models that we developed are machine learning model and fuzzy logic model. Since not all features (molecular descriptors) is related to the final result, features selection is done before developing the models. Our aim in this project is to find out whether machine learning model or fuzzy logic model is more accurate and suitable to predict whether a chemical is ready biodegradable (RB) or not ready biodegradable (NRB).
